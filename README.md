# 👋 Hey there, I'm ALI ALSMAN AHMED.

I'm a **Software Developer** specializing in **Embedded Linux** and **Artificial Intelligence**.  
I build things that run close to the metal, talk to sensors, and sometimes even think for themselves 🤖.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 🧠 AI & Machine Learning
- 🛜 Embedded Linux development
- 🔌 Integrating hardware with intelligent software
- 🐧 Building and optimizing systems on devices you probably have in your hand or your car

---

## 🤔 Where Are the Projects?

Yeah, about that...

I'm actively working on things behind the scenes — most of my work involves:
- Internal or private company projects  
- Experimental builds I’m not ready to unleash yet  
- Long nights debugging SPI and I2C like it’s a crime scene

---

## 🚀 Coming Soon

I’ll be uploading selected projects that:
- Combine embedded systems and AI
- Involve real-time systems with smart decision-making
- Show off some cool integrations between hardware & intelligence

## 📬 Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or just geek out over smart systems and low-level code!
